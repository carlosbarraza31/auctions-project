# auctions-project
Repo for CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript Auctions project.

This web application simulates an auctions webpage, where registered users can:
* Create Listings with price, category, and provide an image
* View available listings or all listings (available or closed) and see information about them.
* Click on any active listing and bid for the listed item.
* Win an auction if their bid was the highest bid of the listing.
* Close listings, only if the user is the author of the listing.
* Filter listings by category.
